# Note about fixing package-lock.json

The current package-lock.json file appears to have dependency conflicts or references to packages
that may no longer be available in the npm registry. 

Rather than trying to manually create a package-lock.json file (which would be extremely complex),
we've modified the deployment workflow to:

1. Use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
2. Add the `--no-package-lock` flag to avoid using the existing lock file
3. Updated the package.json to use more compatible dependency versions

This approach should resolve the current build issues while maintaining the
functionality of the application.

If you need to generate a proper package-lock.json file locally:

1. Delete the existing package-lock.json file
2. Run `npm install`
3. Commit the newly generated package-lock.json file

This will ensure all dependencies are properly resolved and locked.
