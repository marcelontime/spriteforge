# Creating a GitHub Social Preview Image for SpriteForge

Since we can't generate the image directly, here are instructions to create a properly sized social preview image:

## Option 1: Use the HTML Template

1. Open the `social-preview.html` file in your browser
2. Take a screenshot of the page (make sure it captures the entire container)
3. Save the screenshot as `social-preview.png`

## Option 2: Manual Image Creation

1. Open the `screenshot1.png` in an image editor (like Photoshop, GIMP, or even PowerPoint)
2. Create a new canvas with dimensions 1280×640 pixels
3. Place the screenshot as background, ensuring it fills the canvas
4. Add a gradient overlay at the bottom (dark blue fading to transparent)
5. Add the text "SpriteForge" in large font
6. Add the tagline "Generate game-ready sprites from photos using OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model"
7. Add the SpriteForge logo in the top right corner
8. Save as `social-preview.png`

## Setting the Social Preview in GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings: https://github.com/marcelontime/spriteforge/settings
2. Scroll down to the "Social preview" section
3. Click "Edit" or "Upload an image"
4. Upload your newly created social preview image
5. Save changes

The recommended GitHub social preview dimensions are 1280×640px.

This will make your project look professional when shared on social media or messaging platforms.
